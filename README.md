# MSDA_WGU_Portfolio
This is a portfolio of my work in the MS Data Analysis degree program at Western Governors University. 

## Prior Experience
I began the program May 1st, 2023 with little to no coding experience, especially with Python. I have a Bachelor's degree in mathematics from a brick and mortar university. The extent of my coding knowledge at the start of this program is as follows. For my Bachelor's I took an introductory C++ class. The extent to which I understand C++ is enough to code a simple card "game," entirely played with text. For my statistics courses, I often used R for simulations, but the code was often provided for us. We were only responsible for understanding how to tweak the code if needed, not write it from scratch. After graduating from college, I became a business analyst. In this role, I taught myself some basic SQL in order to be able to work with business intelligence tools. Most commonly, I write CASE statements in this role, but never had any need to perform JOINs.

## Important Note
Please do not use my work as your own. That is not the intended purpose for this portfolio. This portfolio is meant to be a repository of examples only, since I found such examples to be very helpful in this program.
