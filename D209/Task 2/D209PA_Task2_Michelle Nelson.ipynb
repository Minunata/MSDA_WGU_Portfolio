    "## A1. Research Question\n",
    "\n",
    "For this paper, I will be re-analyzing the question I asked in my D208 Task 1 paper: What factors influence the length of a hospital stay? The linear regression model I used to analyze the data for this question in my previous paper had weak predictive power because of its large error. It is my hope that a random forest, an ensemble method, will prove to be a stronger model for predicting length of hospital stay, represented in this dataset by \"Initial_days.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Decreasing the number of days hospitalized while also still providing quality care ensures that resources such as physicians, medical supplies, and time are not wasted and used efficiently. In addition, shortening days hospitalized should increase patient satisfaction scores so long as adequate time is still taken to care for the patient and they are not rushed out. Thus, identifying the risk factors that contribute to a longer hospital stay could be important for a hospital so the hospital can be proactive instead of reactive when managing patients."

    "## A2. Analysis Objectives and Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "As aforementioned, my goal for this analysis is to create a model that is better able to predict length of hospital stay than my previous attempt using linear regression. As such, I will be using a new type of model, a random forest regressor, to attempt to do so. \n",
    "\n",
    "Speaking more broadly, however, the goal is to attempt to help the hospital to which this data belongs reduce their average length of hospital stay by first identifying the factors that contribute to lengthy stays in the first place. Then, the hospital can use such information to come up with a proactive plan. Long term, the hospital could expect to see benefits such as improved efficiency and reduced costs, as mentioned above, which might also be communicated as a goal of this analysis to a board of executives.

    "## B1. Justification of Classification Method\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to explain a random forest model, I must first explain a decision tree, on which this ensemble model is built. A decision tree works by learning a sequence of if/else questions about the individual features in the dataset it was trained on so it can infer the value of a new observation that is fed to it. These if/else questions subset the data into groups, then subset those subsets into still more subsets until a prediction can be made. When a decision tree is trained, it aims to maximize information gained from each node/question. \n",
    "\n",
    "A decision tree is made up of a hierarchy of \"nodes,\" which can represent either a question or prediction. Each node has only two answers. There are a few types of nodes. A root node is the starting node and represents the initial question the tree asks of the observation to understand which of two groups it belongs to. These child nodes are the first internal nodes, which represent more questions the tree asks of the observation. In this way, the observation follows a path down the tree, being determined to be in one group or the other whenever a question is asked of it at a node. Eventually, this line of questioning culminates in a prediction at the end of a tree, the final node, called a \"leaf.\" Since this is difficult to explain with words, I will include a picture of a decision tree for visualization purposes (Saini, 2024).\n",
    "\n",
    "![Decision Tree Picture](https://av-eks-blogoptimized.s3.amazonaws.com/498772.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "A random forest uses a large number of decision trees together in an ensemble. Many decision trees are made using different randomly selected subsets of both the data and the features. Each tree in the ensemble then makes a prediction. The random forest model then makes its own prediction by looking at all of the predictions made by the many trees within it. It averages those predictions into one final prediction. Since this may be difficult to visualize, I have included an image to better explain this concept too (Machine Learning Random Forest Algorithm - JavatPoint, n.d.).\n",

    "## B2. Random Forest Model Assumptions\n",
    "\n",
    "Random forest models make very few assumptions. The one I have chosen to highlight is the assumption that the data has no formal distribution such as a normal distribution. Because a random forest is a non-parametric model, it can still predict on skewed data, or data with multiple modes (Vishalmendekarhere, 2021). If the data in question does have a formal distribution, it might be wiser to choose a technique that makes an assumption of whatever formal distribution the data displays."

    "\n",
    "For this project, I will be using Python and the following packages:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Pandas\n",
    "    * Pandas is useful because it allows us a framework for working with the data. Without it, using only numpy arrays would be rather clunky. Pandas allows the data to resemble a spreadsheet.\n",
    "* NumPy\n",
    "    * In this case, I will be using numpy for certain mathematical operations like summing, squaring, or square rooting.\n",
    "* Seaborn\n",
    "    * This package is handy in combination with matplotlib.pyplot because it expands the kinds of graphs we can use to plot the data. With seaborn, I can create scatterplots, plots with a line of best fit, and so on.\n",
    "* Matplotlib.pyplot\n",
    "    * I will primarily be using this to create graphs.\n",
    "* Sklearn\n",
    "    * sklearn.ensemble: I will be using RandomeForestRegressor from this package, which is the regression algorithm I will be using to run analysis on this data.\n",
    "    * sklearn.model_selection: I will use train_test_split from this package, which I will use to easily divide the dataset into train and test datasets. I will also use RandomizedSearchCV from this package to do some basic hyperparameter tuning.\n",
    "    * sklearn.metrics: I will use this package's mean_squared_error and r2_score to evaluate the model's performance."

    "\n",
    "I will be performing several data preparation steps so that the data is ready for random forest regression, many of which are directly taken from my D208 paper. However, the most important step I feel I should highlight is creating dummy variables using one-hot encoding. This process converts a categorical variable column's values from their labels like \"male\" and \"female\" to integer representations that a random forest regression model can understand, with one column for each category. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, let's take a look at Gender. If a 1 appears in the dummy column for male, we know the patient was male. If a 1 appears in the dummy column for female, we know the patient was female. If 0 appears in both columns, we know the patient was non-binary, but for a random forest regressor, we should actually keep the dummy non-binary column, which would hold a 1 if the patient is non-binary. For linear and logistic regression, it is common practice to drop one of these three columns because zeros in the other two tell you that the third would hold a one. This is because for linear and logistic regression, keeping a dummy column for each category present in the original column would cause multicollinearity issues, which linear and logistic regression are both sensitive to. A random forest model does not suffer from this problem because it does not make linear combinations of the features (Categorical Predictors: How Many Dummies to Use in Regression Vs. K-nearest Neighbors, n.d.). Thus, when I create dummy variables for my categorical columns, I will keep a dummy column for each category in the column and refrain from dropping one."

    "For my analysis, I will not use columns whose data is categorical with a high cardinality of choices. These columns would require one-hot encoding, which, when performed on columns such as these, greatly expands the dataset columnwise. For example, the column \"Job\" has 639 different choices for occupation (see the code for obtaining this number below.) Performing one-hot encoding on this column would result in the addition of 639 new columns to the dataframe and the removal of the original column. Expanding the dataframe to such a size would not only be cumbersome, but it also increases the risk that my laptop would be set aflame by the sheer processing power required for a random forest model running on that many features. For my D208 paper, I excluded high cardinality categorical variables for the same reason."

    "Now that the data is cleaner (despite being labeled as already cleaned,) let us move on to items that are more in the data preparation realm. First, I will create dummy variables for all of the categorical columns I intend to use for random forest analysis since a random forest requires numeric representations of categorical variables. For columns with choice cardinality greater than two, I will use get_dummies. I will keep every column generated by get_dummies instead of dropping one of them as I would for logistic and linear regression. For columns with choice cardinality equal to two, I will simply make a boolean mapping dictionary and use that to map yes to 1 and no to 0. These dummy variables will be inserted into a new dataframe made to house solely the variables I am interested in for random forest regression."

    "## D2. Analysis Technique & Calculations\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned previously, random forest regression is a group of decision trees. First, a specified number of decision trees are created, each using a random subset of datapoints from the training dataset. When a new datapoint is fed to this ensemble of trees, each tree makes its own prediction by asking a series of true or false questions of the datapoint to figure out which groups and sub-groups learned by the tree that the new datapoint falls into until it reaches a leaf node (the end of the tree,) where a prediction is made about the datapoint. The predictions of all the individual decision trees are then averaged to produce a final prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, say we want to predict a day's temperature from weather data. The first question or root node a decision tree might ask is, \"Is it summer?\" If true, the tree would follow the true path to the next node, where it might ask, \"Is it overcast?\" If false, the tree would then follow the false path to the next node, where it might ask, \"Is the humidity less than .5?\" This question's answer might then lead to a leaf node. The number of branches a tree can have before the end is reached is specified by the analyst's supplied max_depth parameter. At the leaf node, this individual decision tree will make a prediction, let's say, 78 degrees. Another tree in the ensemble might come to the conclusion of 70, while yet another might predict 82. If these three trees are the entire ensemble, these three predictions are then averaged, resulting in a final prediction of 76.7 degrees.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to note that I will be using only the default settings for this random forest regression model with the exception of n_estimators, max_depth, and min_samples_leaf, which I will discuss later. There are many parameters for a random forest, but I will go over the most commonly used ones that influence how the random forest behaves in regards to split calculation and training here. The default \"criterion\" parameter for random forest is \"squared_error.\" This means that the quality of a split (the result of asking a question of a datapoint,) is measured using the function mean squared error. Since some of the other options are significantly slower to use when training the model, the default will be kept. The default for min_samples_split is 2, which indicates that the minimum number of samples required to split an internal node is two. Some might set this higher, but this makes sense as an absolute minimum-- you physically cannot split 1 sample into two branches. Because I don't want to limit the trees too much in my initial random forest, I won't raise this value and will just keep the default here as well. If I find out later that the ensemble overfits, I could raise this to combat overfitting. Another parameter I will leave at the default is min_weight_fraction_leaf. This defaults to 0.0, indicating that there is no weighting of features involved in the trees. This parameter is useful if there is some indication that some features in the predictor dataset are more important and reliable than others. I do not believe this to be the case, so I will not change the default. Max_features defaults to 1.0, which I will not change. This influences the number of features considered when attempting to find the best split. The value 1.0 considers all features. This parameter is useful in decorrelating trees, if correlation is found to be a problem. This is another parameter I would consider changing after evaluating the initial model's performance. Max_leaf_nodes defaults to \"None,\" which indicates there is no limit on the number of leaves a tree can have. I see no reason to limit the trees on the random forest's initial run, as it limits the trees. Min_impurity_decrease defaults to 0.0, which indicates that the trees must make splits where the impurity decreases by at least 0.0. Setting a threshold here can help deter the tree from making less meaningful splits, and thus it is yet another parameter I would consider changing after evaluating the initial model's performance. It is customary for trees to be built from bootstrap samples of the training dataset. This helps introduce randomness in the tree building process that can improve model performance. Thus, I will keep the bootstrap parameter equal to its default \"True.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us now discuss n_estimators, max_depth, and min_samples_leaf. These important parameters can be arbitrarily picked, but it is common also to use hyperparameter tuning to pick more ideal values for them. This assignment does not require hyperparameter tuning, but in the absence of a better way to pick the values for these parameters, I will perform it anyway for this limited set of parameters using RandomizedSearchCV. RandomizedSearchCV, unlike GridSearchCV, checks several random combinations of the parameters supplied to it, while GridSearchCV checks all combinations of the parameters supplied to it. As such, RandomizedSearchCV takes less time and computational power while still providing an improvement in performance over a model with parameters chosen arbitrarily. With RandomizedSearchCV, I can feed in larger lists of possible parameters without the risk of my computer catching fire from the sheer computational power required to do GridSearchCV on the same lists. It also saves my hair from being pulled out from the enormous amount of time it would take GridSearchCV on such a set of lists.\n",

    "\n",
    "The code that returns MSE, which quantifies the model's accuracy, can be viewed above. I have also provided code for the calculation of RMSE, which is easier to interpret, and R-squared to help explain the model's performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, this model is not any better than the linear regression model I used in my previous paper, which continues to cause me frustration. The MSE, or mean squared error, for this model is 195.3. It is better for MSE to be lower rather than higher. A higher MSE means the errors from which it is calculated are, on average, high. A smaller MSE means the opposite. The smaller the MSE, the smaller the errors between the predictions and the true values, and thus, the better the model. The MSE for this model is rather high. The MSE for an ideal model would be as close to 0 as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "MSE, however, is difficult to interpret by itself, since the errors are squared and the unit, in this case, days squared, is less intuitive. Thus, it is helpful to take MSE and calculate RMSE from it, which uses the natural unit of the outcome variable in question, making it easier to understand. The RMSE of this model was 14.0 days, rounded to the tenths place. This means that on average, the difference between the predictions and the true values of initial_days were 14 days apart-- an error of about two weeks. This value of RMSE, in my opinion, is decent, but those with domain knowledge may disagree based on how vital it is to know exactly how long a hospital will be. And, as always, the lower the RMSE, the better.\n",
    "\n",
    "MSE, in my opinion, is better for comparing models, while RMSE is better for understanding the performance of a single model. The MSEs of the linear regression model and the random forest were almost exactly the same, with linear regression outperforming the random forest by a marginal amount. Thus, I have not succeeded in creating a better model. Rather, I have created a very similar one.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, though it is not required by the rubric, let us discuss R-squared. R-squared, also known as the coefficient of determination, tells us how much of the variance in the response variable, length of hospital stay, can be predicted by the explanatory variables. The maximum for R-squared is 1, and the closer to 1 this value is, the better the model. The random forest model achieved an R-squared of 0.72. This, again, reinforces the fact that the random forest did marginally worse than the linear regression model, which got an R-squared value of 0.73. Neither of these R-squared values are impressive. Rather, they are fairly mediocre, explaining only roughly 70% of the variance in hospital stay."

    "With an R-squared of 0.72 and an MSE of 195.3, the linear regression model narrowly outperformed the random forest model, and thus, is actually marginally worse than the linear regression model. However, the random forest model is still better at predicting than, say, throwing darts at a board of randomly placed and numbered Post-it notes to predict the length of hospital stay (unlike my classification model in Task 1.) However, both models are almost equally mediocre, and other analysis techniques that might perform better should be considered going forward, as there is a *lot* of room for improvement. 30% of the variation in length of hospital stay remains unexplained by the model, a gap that is almost unacceptable. The random forest model, and thus, the linear regression model, could both be deemed passable, however, if the 14-day error is \"close enough\" to the true value to be usable by the hospital in an actionable plan. Determining whether or not this level of precision is acceptable, however, would require domain knowledge I simply don't possess."

    "## E3. Analysis Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "The major limitation for the random forest analysis I performed is that this technique is rather biased when dealing with categorical variables (Vishalmendekarhere, 2021). The features I chose to use to predict length of hospital stay were almost all categorical. Of the 12 original variables (before they were dummied,) only two were numeric. The rest were all categorical. Because I had so many categorical variables, a weakness for random forests, performance could have suffered. In particular, random forests are biased towards categorical variables with multiple categories because feature selection is based on impurity reduction (Goyal, 2022). This means that the feature Services, which has four categories--more than any other categorical variable, might have been biased towards by the model. In addition, gender, initial_admin, and complication_risk, which each have three choices, may also have been biased towards more than the condition variables such as diabetes or anxiety, which only have two. This bias makes the results of the random forest questionable at best."

    "## E4. Recommended Action\n",
    "\n",
    "Since this model is fairly mediocre, there are a few avenues I would recommend considering. First, one could try to improve the random forest model with more hyperparameter tuning. I tuned three hyperparameters--n_estimators, max_depth, and min_samples_leaf--which I chose to tune because they are the most commonly tuned hyperparameters for a random forest model. However, it might end up being beneficial to tune even more hyperparameters. Helpful hyperparameters to consider tuning can be found in the sklearn ensemble documentation that I briefly discussed in section D2.\n",
    "\n",
    "Secondly, the analyst might perhaps include more variables in the feature dataset. I limited myself to 12 because I was trying to compare against a past model I created using linear regression. Thus, I would recommend the analyst re-run the random forest on as many features as possible while still excluding categorical variables with a high cardinality of choices, since this would bias the model and expand the dataset far too much column-wise.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, one might abandon the random forest altogether, since the dataset is composed of mostly categorical variables, a weakness for random forests. In that case, I would recommend that the analyst try other models such as Lasso or Ridge regression."
